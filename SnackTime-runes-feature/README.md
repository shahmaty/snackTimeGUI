# SnackTime
Be me. Have 2080ti and 3900x. League just loads to fast. Like when tf am I supposed to go get snacks without missing champ select or the first 5 minutes of a game. Well, if you're like me and have too much money to put into gpu and cpu power, snacktime will use AI and Machine learing algorithms to get you through champ select without you touching a thing!
